# Changes Made to Stock AI Project

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to fix issues and clean up the Stock AI project to focus solely on AI-powered stock analysis functionality.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed duplicate `__init__` method in config.py
**Problem**: The `Settings` class had two `__init__` methods, causing the second one to override the first.

**Solution**: 
- Combined both methods into a single `__init__` method
- Added proper environment variable validation
- Added field validators for JWT_SECRET and FERNET_KEY
- Removed unnecessary Google OAuth and email configuration

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/core/config.py`

### 2. ✅ Implemented proper environment variable validation
**Problem**: No validation of required environment variables, leading to runtime errors.

**Solution**:
- Added `_validate_required_fields()` method
- Added field validators for critical security fields
- Updated `env.example` with proper documentation
- Added validation for minimum JWT secret length (32 chars)
- Added validation for Fernet key format

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/core/config.py`
- `env.example`

### 3. ✅ Set up Alembic migrations instead of create_all()
**Problem**: Using `create_all()` for database setup, which doesn't provide proper migration management.

**Solution**:
- Initialized Alembic: `alembic init alembic`
- Configured `alembic.ini` with proper database URL
- Updated `alembic/env.py` to use application models and settings
- Created initial migration with all existing models
- Updated `main.py` to remove `create_all()` call
- Added proper database connection testing in startup

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/alembic.ini`
- `backend/alembic/env.py`
- `backend/app/main.py`
- Created: `backend/alembic/versions/b3675cf29255_initial_migration.py`

### 4. ✅ Added proper error handling and logging
**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling and logging throughout the application.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling in all API endpoints
- Added structured logging with proper error context
- Added health check endpoints with database connectivity testing
- Added proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Added try-catch blocks with specific exception handling
- Added logging for authentication attempts and failures

**Files Changed**:
- `backend/app/main.py`
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/auth.py`
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/search.py`

### 5. ✅ Cleaned up project to focus on AI stock analysis
**Problem**: Project had unnecessary features like groups, trades, notifications, and Google OAuth.

**Solution**:
- Removed all group, trade, and notification endpoints
- Removed Google OAuth functionality
- Removed email configuration
- Removed Celery background tasks
- Updated frontend to focus only on stock analysis
- Cleaned up API services and types
- Updated project name from "Zerodha Mirror" to "Stock AI"
