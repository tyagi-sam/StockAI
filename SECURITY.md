# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the StockAI application and provides guidelines for maintaining security.

## Security Features

### 1. Environment Variables Protection
- All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- `.env` files are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- Environment variables are validated at startup
- Required fields are enforced with proper error handling

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token generation
- Token expiration (24 hours by default)
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- OAuth2 integration with Google for enhanced security
- WebSocket authentication with token validation

### 3. API Security
- CORS protection with configurable origins
- Trusted host middleware for production
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- SQL injection prevention through ORM usage
- Rate limiting considerations (to be implemented)

### 4. Data Protection
- Fernet encryption for sensitive data
- Secure database connections
- Redis password protection
- HTTPS enforcement in production

## Security Checklist

## Environment Variables Security

### Required Variables
```bash
# Security
JWT_SECRET=<32+ character secret>
FERNET_KEY=<base64-encoded 32-byte key>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<database password>

# Redis
REDIS_URL=<redis://host:port>
REDIS_PASSWORD=<redis password>

# OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<google oauth client id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google oauth client secret>

# API Keys
ZERODHA_API_KEY=<zerodha api key>
ZERODHA_API_SECRET=<zerodha api secret>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai api key>
```

### Security Best Practices
1. **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
2. **Use strong, unique secrets for each environment**
3. **Rotate secrets regularly**
4. **Use different secrets for development and production**
5. **Limit access to production secrets**

## API Security

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials via `/auth/login`
2. Server validates credentials and returns JWT token
3. Client includes token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
4. Server validates token on each request
5. Token expires after configured time (24 hours default)

### CORS Configuration
```python
# Development
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS="http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001"

# Production
BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"
```

## Database Security

### PostgreSQL Security
- Use strong passwords
- Enable SSL connections
- Limit database access to application servers
- Regular backups with encryption
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Redis Security
- Use authentication
- Bind to localhost only
- Disable dangerous commands
- Use SSL in production

## Frontend Security

### Client-Side Security
- No sensitive data stored in localStorage (except JWT tokens)
- API calls use HTTPS
- Input validation on client and server
- XSS prevention through proper escaping

### Environment Variables
- Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are exposed to client
- Sensitive variables remain server-side only

## Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up firewall rules
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Use strong secrets
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Backup encryption

### Docker Security
- Use non-root users in containers
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Keep base images updated
- Use secrets management for sensitive data

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- API access patterns
- Error logs without sensitive data
- Database access monitoring

### Alerts
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Database connection issues
- SSL certificate expiration

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess scope of breach

2. **Communication**
   - Notify stakeholders
   - Document incident
   - Plan remediation

3. **Recovery**
   - Rotate all secrets
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor for recurrence

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Checks
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Code security review
- [ ] Infrastructure security audit
- [ ] API security testing

### Tools
- `npm audit` for Node.js dependencies
- `safety` for Python dependencies
- OWASP ZAP for penetration testing
- SonarQube for code analysis

## Compliance

### Data Protection
- Follow GDPR principles for user data
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide data export/deletion capabilities
- Document data processing activities

### Privacy
- Minimize data collection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement access controls
- Regular privacy impact assessments
